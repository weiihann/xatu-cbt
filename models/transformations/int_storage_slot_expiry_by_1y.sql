-- Tracks storage slots eligible for expiry: slots written 1 year ago with no subsequent access.
-- A slot expires at block N if it was last written at timestamp(N) - 1 year and not accessed since.
-- "Access" includes both writes (storage diffs) AND reads - any interaction resets the expiry clock.
--
-- Optimization: Uses int_storage_slot_next_touch for O(1) expiry range checks.
-- Instead of scanning 1 year of touches and building arrays, we do a direct lookup
-- to check if the next touch (if any) is after the expiry block.
